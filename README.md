# AudioRouteChangeMonitor

## Description

A developer tool for monitoring audio route changes on iOS, such as switching to a different audio device or when a device becomes unavailable.

All route changes are recorded and viewable as a table on iPad or a list with expandable items on iPhone.

The list can be cleared and shared as a JSON file.

You can download the app from the App Store for basic monitoring once it becomes available or build it locally from this repository for more advanced debugging scenarios.

## Purpose

Understanding the precise order of audio route changes is crucial, as different types of devices can behave unpredictably. This tool helps developers track and analyze these changes effectively.

## TODO

 - Allow audio session setup from the UI.
 - Enable exporting of individual route changes.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests to enhance the app's functionality.
